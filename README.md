### **Unit Conversion & Wastewater Calculations**  

This project is a **unit conversion calculator** and **wastewater calculation tool** designed for environmental engineering applications. It includes various unit conversions and a formula-based calculator for **lbs/day calculations** in wastewater treatment.  

---

## **📌 Features**  
✔️ **Unit Conversions** (Gallons, MGD, GPM, GPH, GPS, Cubic Feet, Pounds, etc.)  
✔️ **Lbs/day Calculation** (`Concentration (mg/L) * Flow (MGD) * 8.34`)  
✔️ **Mobile-Friendly UI** (Responsive Design)  
✔️ **Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (if applicable)**  
✔️ **User-Friendly Interface**  

---

## **📏 Supported Unit Conversions**  
- **Gallons ↔ Million Gallons (MG)**  
- **Cubic Feet ↔ Gallons**  
- **Gallons ↔ Pounds**  
- **GPM (Gallons per Minute) ↔ GPH (Gallons per Hour) ↔ GPS (Gallons per Second) ↔ MGD (Million Gallons per Day)**  
- **MGD ↔ GPM ↔ GPH ↔ GPS ↔ MG/hour**  

### **💧 Lbs/day Calculation**  
This tool calculates the **loading rate** in pounds per day using the formula:  
```plaintext
lbs/day = Concentration (mg/L) × Flow (MGD) × 8.34
```
